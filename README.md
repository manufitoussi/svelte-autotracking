# Svelte Autotracking

> A library to automatically track changes on Svelte stores with decorators.

It's freely inspired by the [`@tracked` decorator](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/functions/@glimmer%2Ftracking/tracked) from Ember.js, and it's meant to be used with [Svelte stores](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte-store).

If you're using Svelte stores, you know that you need create complex logic (like derived stores and custom store) to track changes on your components. Even the simplest of them.

This library aims to simplify this process by providing a set of decorators and helpers that you can use to :
- automatically track changes on your object logic
- and automaticaly create stores to be cosumed by your components.

> You have just to concentrate on your logic, create your objects and let the library handle the rest.
